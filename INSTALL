# SimPack Installation Notes #
##############################

SimPack is a generic Java library of similarity measures for the use in
ontologies and other application domains.

The measures in SimPack are intended to be used out of the box. To use
the measures put all the jar files in the lib directory on the Java
classpath.

Requirements:
- Java 1.5 (http://java.sun.com)
- Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Step-by-step installation:

1/ Compile the SimPack sources by executing 'ant dist' on the command line.
This results in a SimPack jar in the dist directory.

2/ Put the resulting SimPack jar file in the dist directory on the java
classpath together with all the jar files in the lib directory.

Have a look at the JUnit tests in tests directory to obtain a basic
understanding of how to use the measures.
